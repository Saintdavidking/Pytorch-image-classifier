# Pytorch-image-classifier
PyTorch Image Classifier A simple yet powerful Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with PyTorch for image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset. 
Features  Easy Setup: One-command installation and training Interactive Classification: 
Upload and classify your own images Real-time Training: Live progress. with a 78% accuracy.


```To run this classifier:

First step: Install dependencies using the command below:
```

pip install torch torchvision matplotlib numpy

```
it will automatically download CIFAR-10 dataset, train for 5 epochs, evaluate performance, and show training plots and sample prediction.

Immediate Next Steps: Run the command below to start the program:
```

python classifier.py

``` The training will now be more informative and should produce a nice results.
You'll see detailed progress updates, beautiful plots, and a professional summary at the end!
```
